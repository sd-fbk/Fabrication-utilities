# Fabrication-utilities

Plugin for fabrication processes.

This `nomad` plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter` along with `@nomad`'s [`cookiecutter-nomad-plugin`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/cookiecutter-nomad-plugin) template.


## Adding this plugin to NOMAD

Currently, NOMAD has two distinct flavors that are relevant depending on your role as an user:
1. [A NOMAD Oasis](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-nomad-oasis): any user with a NOMAD Oasis instance.
2. [Local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-local-nomad-installation-and-the-source-code-of-nomad): internal developers.

### Adding this plugin in your NOMAD Oasis

Read the [NOMAD plugin documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html) for all details on how to deploy the plugin on your NOMAD instance.

### Adding this plugin in your local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD

Modify the text file under `/nomad/default_plugins.txt` and add:
```sh
<other-content-in-default_plugins.txt>
Fabrication-utilities==x.y.z
```
where `x.y.z` represents the released version of this plugin.

Then, go to your NOMAD folder, activate your NOMAD virtual environment and run:
```sh
deactivate
cd <route-to-NOMAD-folder>/nomad
source .pyenv/bin/activate
./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
```

Alternatively and only valid for your local NOMAD installation, you can modify `nomad.yaml` to include this plugin, see [NOMAD Oasis - Install plugins](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html).


### Build the python package

The `pyproject.toml` file contains everything that is necessary to turn the project
into a pip installable python package. Run the python build tool to create a package distribution:

```sh
pip install build
python -m build --sdist
```

You can install the package with pip:

```sh
pip install dist/Fabrication-utilities-1.10.0
```

Read more about python packages, `pyproject.toml`, and how to upload packages to PyPI
on the [PyPI documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).


### Template update

We use cruft to update the project based on template changes. A `cruft-update.yml` is included in Github workflows to automatically check for updates and create pull requests to apply updates. Follow the [instructions](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-03-github-actions-prevent-github-actions-from-creating-and-approving-pull-requests/) on how to enable >
To run the check for updates locally, follow the instructions on [`cruft` website](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#updating-a-project).

## Description of the plugin

The plugin is intended as an extension of an oasis or a local instance of NOMAD. It could be useful to describe some critcal fabrication and characterization steps employed in micro and nano fabrication.
It is built with three main sections. The tests folder contains some scripts used to test some features
of the package. As an example you can find for the app that the test is run onto the the so
called "transapp" (for more details see the docs and the code in src/fabrication_utilities/apps/transapp.py). For the schema packages an example yaml file is defined in the tests/data folder and it is called by the testing module in the tests/schema_packages. Following the already defined method you can test all the features present in the plugin defining y>
